summary: |
  Before becoming obsessed with UX for enterprise software, I explored lots of creative avenues during and after university.  Still, I have always been drawn to scientific, technical, and sociological topics even in my creative and academic design and development endeavorsâ€”from designing and building a "window" into an astronomical research facility's live feeds of solar, meteorological, seismic, and astronomical data, to a fictional employee onboarding portal for a biohacking corporation, to an application for manipulating spectroscopy data.  
  
  I love learning about the complex and amazing ways that people learn about the universe, educate others, build incredible things, and steward each other and our world.  My true passion is to help build tools that empower people to do these things even more effectively and efficiently.
