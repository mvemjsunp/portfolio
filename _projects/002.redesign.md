<p>It's natural for any software product to get more complex over time.  This tendency is even greater with enterprise/B2B products.</p>
<!-- <p>Customers and stakeholders are constantly requesting new features.  Product teams scramble to build them in service of pleasing their users.  This tug-of-war fractures what was once a cohesive user experience.  Design trends wax and wane, leaving remnants of yesterday's popular patterns and aesthetics scattered in dark corners of the application.</p> -->
<p>  Users of highly specialized software for niche markets have an incredibly diverse range of business processes, needs, and internal cultures.  Customers are constantly requesting new and specialized features.  Product teams are eager to build them to keep users happy, but this can splinter what was once a cohesive user experience.</p>
<p>This was just one aspect of the challenge I faced with redesigning Locus' environmental data management software.  It was a cloud software product that was built and designed by environmental engineers, for environmental engineers, and that had grown steadily (in size and complexity) over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>As I would learn, the goal is not "making the complex simple".  Often, trying to force simplicity on inherently complex systems is destructive for end users.</p>
<p>With methodical planning, comprehensive research, and careful design, <b>I led efforts to consolidate, restructure, and improve the UI and UX of the environmental software platform</b>.</p>

## A truly epic redesign challenge
Locus' flagship application, EIM (Environmental Information Management), was first introduced in 1999. It was designed and developed by environmental engineers, largely to support their work as technical consultants for clients' environmental remediation and long-term monitoring projects.

Over the years, EIM grew and grew, reflecting the ever-changing regulatory landscape and the expanding roles of environmental management professionals. The product team often built out fully customized modules within EIM for some customers.  It seemed as if each customer was subject to different local regulations or industry-specific needs.

By the time I joined the company, EIM was a monster of a web app.  The code repository contained more than 16,000 files (in the core project alone) and **no UX or UI design strategy** to speak of.

From the user's perspective, it was about as painful as it was powerful.

{% endslider %}

## Planning and project management
I was tasked with planning and implementing the redesign project when I first started at the company as a front-end developer/interaction designer. For awhile, I was solely responsible for keeping this project moving forward. This included:

- Choosing and implementing a **modern CSS framework** (highly customized Bootstrap + Sass)
- Redesigning and rebuilding the **main navigation and application layout**
- Establishing **standard layout components** and a [pattern library/style guide](/projects/003.patternlibrary) that developers can use as a reference
- Redesigning, reorganizing, and redeveloping the entirety of the application in accordance with these standards
- Ensuring all **new pages follow the standards**—this usually involved some "cleaning up" after the developer

### Expanding my team, coordinating work with product roadmap

After a year of doing front-end design and development, I **hired a front-end developer to work on my team**.  I would supervise this new developer who took over most of my front-end development work (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ColdFusion, SQL). Now, I could focus more on design, establishing standards, ensuring quality, and prioritizing work.

Choosing which sections/modules to redesign and when depended on several factors.  The product roadmap, largely determined by product managers and customer needs, often made the decision for us. Sometimes the product team needed to build a lot of new functionality or drastically rework a particular module.

**I attended product meetings to keep aware of these timelines and tried to coordinate the redesign alongside the functionality changes** whenever possible. This reduced time needed for testing and minimized <a href="https://articles.uie.com/embraceable_change/" target="_blank">the friction involved</a> when introducing significant changes to users.

### Evaluating the existing information architecture
To keep track of progress and develop a point of reference for the redesign project, **I set up spreadsheets that would eventually become a comprehensive site map** of the entire application. Of course, it wasn’t feasible to map the entire thing at once (did I mention the code repository started out at over 16k files?).  So the front-end developer and I updated the spreadsheet bit by bit, anytime we worked on a new section.

On these spreadsheets, we noted:
* page flows
* hierarchy within menu structure
* important enhancement case ticket numbers related to the page
* file names
* h1/h2/h3 page titles
* breadcrumbs
* summary of UI elements (forms, grid, types of form fields, instructions text, etc.)
* a color indication of the current status of the redesign (not done, in process, in testing, complete) for an at-a-glance overview

<!-- {% include project-image.html file="redesign/plan_site-map-combined_960x420.png" extraClasses="hidden-sm" description="I created a separate spreadsheet file for each main menu section, and within each file created a tab for each second-level menu item." %} -->

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/plan_site-map-files_960x620.png" description="I created a separate spreadsheet file for each main menu section, and within these files created a tab for each second-level menu item." %}

## Iterative and in-depth product research

For each new section that we chose to tackle, I started by **conducting research to fully understand its purpose**, including:
* its evolution over time
* how it was intertwined with other modules
* how heavily it was used and by whom
* which problems it solved for our users
* known problems reported by internal or customer users
* enhancement requests related to the module

This process involved:

{% capture iconsummary %}
These could sometime be many pages long, or they might not exist at all.  If I was lucky, the help file included descriptions of each field in a form, as well as guidance to the user on the purpose of the module and how to navigate the flow.
{% endcapture %}

{% include icon-list.html icon="helpfile" title="Reading on-page help files" summary=iconsummary %}

{% capture iconsummary %}
While time-consuming to review, our support ticket platform proved to be an invaluable resource during the redesign. It was essentially a comprehensive log of development changes (and the reasons behind them!), recurring problems, and usability issues. I looked through customer correspondence in these tickets to better understand a given form or workflow from an actual user's point-of-view.  I tagged and bookmarked especially interesting customer inquiries or rich historical context for modules I knew we'd eventually work on.
{% endcapture %}
   
{% include icon-list.html icon="customers" title="Combing through the bug tracking/customer correspondence system" summary=iconsummary %}

{% capture iconsummary %}
Usually these only existed for larger, more complex modules, but they provided a more significant depth of information that was actually written with new users in mind.
{% endcapture %}

{% include icon-list.html icon="documentation" title="Reading downloadable user guides" summary=iconsummary %}

{% capture iconsummary %}
   Our support team conducted monthly virtual training sessions on selected modules. At the end of each of these was a Q&A period where users could bring up any issues or ask how to accomplish a particular task.  I often skipped ahead to these precious few minutes for a goldmine of insight. But the trainings themselves also had some nuggets of useful information, as I would often catch the presenter explaining &ldquo;workarounds&rdquo; for a not-entirely-intuitive flow or form field.
{% endcapture %}

{% include icon-list.html icon="video" title="Watching recordings of past training videos" summary=iconsummary extraClasses="last" %}

From each of these sources, I compiled notes in a spreadsheet related to:

* Suggestions or complaints directly from users (in ticket system cases or training Q&As)
* Problem spots in the UI where hosts got tripped up during demos or product trainings
* Sections of help files or user guides that went into great detail to explain the complex machinations behind a process, or the idiosyncrasies of a particular form or flow

All of these signaled **prime opportunities for improvement**.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/research_spreadsheet-historical-cases_960x685.png" description="The spreadsheets, while dense with information, worked well as a guiding force to identify recurring issues and the most important areas of concern." %}

## Design

### Brainstorming and sketching
I always start working on a project by trying to understand "the big picture", like how a section fits into the product and the overall user workflow.  Then I focus on the details, like the purpose and context of each form field or grid column, as well as conditional paths within a flow. After I have a good grasp on both, I'm ready to start ideating potential improvements.

Before jumping into Balsamiq, Photoshop, browser dev tools, or InVision, I **make a point to spend some time with pen and paper**.  Sometimes the redesign for a given form or workflow seems obvious based on similar pages that I’ve worked on.  Plus, knowing the possibilities and constraints of the widgets, patterns, and CSS components in our library tends to direct my brainstorming in certain directions.  

Nevertheless, **I always try to challenge myself to <a href="https://medium.com/ux-immersion-interactions/jedi-designer-tricks-for-exploring-multiple-variations-ca720aef3fe2" target="_blank">explore multiple variations</a>**.  Often, I uncover unexpected and ultimately successful solutions after spending a bit of time pushing myself to take more risks and think outside the box.

This is so much more effective with the freedom of pen and paper than designing in the browser or playing with combinations of existing symbols in Balsamiq.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/design-sketches_960x850.jpg" description="Putting pen to paper helps get beyond the seductive first and obvious idea." %}

### Mapping a new information architecture
Because I **needed to consider the impact of changes** to a given module or form across the entire application, I mapped out the existing files and flow.  Many pages were linked from various dashboards or other forms, sometimes jumping into the middle of a form process.  Removing a step in a multi-page form or combining files could disrupt other flows.  I searched for each filename throughout our code repository to track down every link and reference.

Once I understood how all the pages in a module were "connected" to the rest of the application, I could confidently map out a new flow.  This way, I could make sure all functionality was retained, **saving headaches for developers and testers further down the line**.

I also used the mappings as a framework for my periodic <a href="#communicating-changes-follow-up" class="smooth-scroll">&ldquo;UI/UX changes&rdquo; guide</a> for users and internal reference.  These included information like "_before_, you went to page A which linked to pages B, C, and D to edit these attributes—_now_, all this functionality is on one screen that’s split up into collapsible panels, which show up conditionally (based on your previous selections)".

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/design-ia-new_960x670.png" description="I kept track of the old and new page flows, including which files the developers would need to deal with." %}

### Wireframes and mockups, design and development specs

I quickly learned that it was helpful to provide both **interactive prototypes and static, annotated documents** with all the wireframes/mockups.  The static document provides thorough, detailed specifications, while the prototype can better show the higher-level interaction flow.
 
Depending on how well I knew the developer who would be working on a given section or page (and their level of experience), I sometimes **provided very detailed design and functional specifications**.  These could include code snippets with specific HTML/CSS/JS that they could use to successfully implement my designs.

This obviously took more time that only providing wireframes and mockups, but it was necessary for more junior developers. It was also helpful if we were working with newer widgets or more complex interaction flows.

Whether I provided these detailed specs or only mid-fidelity wireframes, I always **maintained constant communication with developers throughout the process**.  Whenever possible, I personally reviewed the committed changes to be sure everything came out as intended.

{% endslider %}

## Before and after
Here are a few examples of forms and modules that I redesigned alongside a developer. The &ldquo;after&rdquo; examples are screenshots of the final shipped interface.

### Best result resolution
The 'Best result resolution' form is used to identify which result to use in reporting and visualization, in the case that more than one field sample result was entered into the system (sometimes field samplers take duplicate samples for QC purposes, or lab analyses could be uploaded more than once).

{% capture bestresultbefore1 %}
Before, you reached an individual record by clicking a link in a grid of records. You were taken to a new page and could no longer see the other records.  When you saved or returned from here, you were sent back to the grid of records.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultbefore2 %}
Non-editable fields were simply disabled inputs, but they had no styling to distinguish them from editable fields. Notes were added near the form to indicate which fields were editable.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_best-result_before_960x610.png" title="Best result resolution: BEFORE" label1=bestresultbefore1 label2=bestresultbefore2 %}

{% capture bestresultafter1 %}
Now, the individual records, when clicked, appear in a dialog window above the grid of all records, <b>keeping the context of the record always in the backdrop for quick reference</b>.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultafter2 %}
Display information common to both compared records "across" the top of both of them—<b>to visually indicate their commonality</b>.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultafter3 %}
Icons, color-coding, white space, and standaradized headings provide <b>clearer information hierarchies</b> and <b>better signaling of system status</b>.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultafter4 %}
Since the record editing form now appears in a dialog above the grid of all records, it <b>feels faster and less risky</b> to save or cancel the form.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_best-result_after_960x600.png" title="Best result resolution: AFTER" label1=bestresultafter1 label2=bestresultafter2 label3=bestresultafter3 label4=bestresultafter4 %}

### Site activities calendar
The 'Site activities calendar' shows an overview of daily data input and validation activities in the system, including the number of datasets loaded and successfully validated, field samples and measurements entered, and field forms completed and submitted for processing.

{% capture calendarbefore1 %}
Before, there were options to filter the calendar for different types of data, but doing so reloaded the entire page.  You could also only view one type of data at a time (EDDs loaded, samples entered, field readings entered, etc.).  
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarbefore2 %}
Calendar dates were clickable (to view a data grid with details about the day's activities), but lacked clear affordances. 
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_calendar_before_960x450.png" title="Site activities calendar: BEFORE" label1=calendarbefore1 label2=calendarbefore2 %}

{% capture calendarafter1 %}
Now, each type of data is clickable, so you can view data grids for a specific data type and date simply by clicking the item in the calendar, providing <b>easier access to related information</b>.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarafter2 %}
Users can click the blue icon next to each data to view a summary of the date's activities.  Tooltips on all links indicate where clicking them will lead, so the user <b>doesn't have to remember where each link goes</b>.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarafter3 %}
Dynamic form elements update the visible calendar data as soon as they are changed—<b>no more reloading the entire page to get new data</b>. You can also now view all types of data at once.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarafter4 %}
A new option to show activities with no record count for a given day (in light gray, non-linked text) makes it <b>easier to get a full picture of the month's activities in a single view</b>—what did and did not occur.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_calendar_after_960x750.png" title="Site activities calendar: AFTER" label1=calendarafter1 label2=calendarafter2 label3=calendarafter3 label4=calendarafter4 %}

---

### Locations input form
This form is used to add and edit "locations", which are the basis of all field data collection and analysis activities in the system.  Most forms throughout the system followed this pattern of "view and page through records one at a time" rather than picking a record from a table of all records.

{% capture locationsbefore1 %}
“Less important” form fields were on a “Supplemental” tab, both in this view-only mode as well as edit mode.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsbefore2 %}
Before, the landing page for the Locations module was a view-only version of the first alphabetical location.  You had to page through using arrows to find a location, then click Edit to get to the editable form.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsbefore3 %}
Additional information related to locations (location aliases, reference elevations, metadata, etc.) were on separate form pages, accessed by clicking the buttons on this view-only version of a location record (the buttons aren’t on the edit form).
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_locations_before_960x630.png" title="Locations input form: BEFORE" label1=locationsbefore1 label2=locationsbefore2 label3=locationsbefore3 %}

{% capture locationsafter1 %}
I thoroughly researched every single form field on these pages to <b>identify and resolve deprecated, duplicate, or misplaced fields</b> (there were several!).  We also grouped similar fields under sub-panels (e.g. “Spatial information” and “Originating information”.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsafter2 %}
All information related to a location record is now <b>visible and editable on a single page</b>.  The information previously split up into separate form pages is grouped into collapsible panels.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsafter3 %}
We built data grids of associated information right into the page, including full add and edit functionality.  Previously, these grids and forms were in an entirely different section.  The consolidated form <b>saves navigation time and prevents errors</b> by providing all information related to a single high-level record (a location) in a single, organized location.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_locations_after_960x730.png" title="Locations input form: AFTER" label1=locationsafter1 label2=locationsafter2 label3=locationsafter3 %}


## Communicating changes with users and internally
There were some hurdles in the beginning of this massive redesign effort.  After we redesigned a few major areas, some users complained that the changes were unexpected and confusing.  Users struggled to re-learn how to complete tasks that they were used to doing a specific (albeit convoluted) way.

So for each release (about every 4-5 weeks), **I began compiling "UX release notes"**, made available to all users in the software's Support center.  This includes detailed before/after notes and screenshots of all significant interface and UX changes.  

The documents were especially well received by the help desk staff.  They used them as an ongoing reference and often sent them directly to users in response to inquiries about the changes.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/ux-changes-docs_960x410.png" description="Examples of content from Monthly UI+UX Changes document sent to all project managers and users." %}

## Outcomes and reflections
After we completed the redesign of a few higher-traffic modules, users began to ask in support tickets and training sessions "when will Form XYZ get the new redesign?"  It was clear that our changes were making the system **more enjoyable and easy-to-use, and in turn making our users more efficient at their work**.

The improved user experience of our software was not the only benefit of the redesign.  As part of my team's work, we continually:
* created templates for reusable components and workflows
* consolidated multi-step “wizards” into simpler dynamic forms
* removed unused or duplicate functionality and deprecated files

Through this effort, we **reduced the main product code repository from around 16,000 files to less than 6,000 files**.  This made future maintenance, platform-wide UI and tech stack updates, help documentation efforts, and general design and development work much more manageable and less burdensome for the entire product team.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/stats-filecount.png" description="Everyone appreciates a cleaner, leaner codebase." %}

### What went well?

#### Communicate with users to alleviate the pain of change.
   After several releases, I began hearing that many power users found the redesign changes to be unexpected, and they struggled with the inconvenience of having to “relearn” how to use a form or module without warning. The “UX release notes” I began compiling to alleviate this pain were well-received by account managers and power users.  However, I wish I had more time to create short demo videos or more visual or interactive explanations of the changes.  The notes were often very text-heavy which I knew some users wouldn't want to read.  I still made a concerted effort to complete and send the notes prior to the changes actually being rolled out live.

#### Establishing a design system early on (and continuously building upon it) saved time and ensured consistency.
   Shortly after embarking on the first modules of the redesign, I started compiling a [pattern library](/projects/003.patternlibrary) to keep track of the widgets we chose, common form layouts, copywriting best practices, and other standards that I was gradually developing.  This became an invaluable reference and an unbelievable boon to not only my small UX/design team during this redesign effort, but also to the development team as a whole during their work on new features.

### What didn't go well?

#### Lack of user testing led to a lot of guesswork.
   We lacked the time and resources to run any kind of user testing on initial designs or prototypes, leading to a lot of assumptions made on the basis of best practices, following existing patterns, and adhering to heuristic guidelines.  Even post-release user testing would have likely identified areas of friction or unforeseen task and process flows leading to further opportunities for improvement.

#### A bit more technical planning for the infrastructure would have made the work much easier.
   If I had a slightly larger team from the beginning, I would have liked to formulate an even more scalable tech stack for our redesigned front end.  A few years in, we started exploring React and other modern frameworks for dynamic front ends and single-page applications.  Although the redesign strategy did consolidate plenty of files and screens, and after awhile we started turning common components into tags and templates, having something like React from the beginning would have made it _much_ easier to create truly reusable components that could be more flexibly combined.
