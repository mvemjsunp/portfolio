{% capture intro %}
<p>The sales and marketing teams at Locus Technologies, a boutique environmental data management software company founded in 1997, had long known that its static, dated, non-CMS-supported website didn't just need a visual design refresh.</p>
<p>It didn't just need some fresh content.</p>
<p>It was in dire need of a major, structural overhaul to make it easier for employees in various departments to add and update content, to improve SEO, to track and improve lead generation, to better address primary customer segments through rich, targeted content, and to promote the company as an industry leader.</p>
<p>Through research and coordination of a talented, cross-department team, <b>I crafted and implemented a strategy to redesign and rebuild the website</b> with a special focus on analysis and reorganization of information architecture, comprehensive content strategy, UX research and design, and an integrated, ongoing analytics plan.</p>

## *No shopping cart here...* A story of a B2B website overhaul

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/old-site-3-screens_960x480.png" description="The previous website was built almost entirely with static HTML files.  There was no CMS, so updates essentially required the help of someone with basic front-end development skills." %}

Product companies that operate B2B—that is, their customers are businesses rather than individual consumers—have <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/b2b-convincing-decision-makers/" target="_blank">a different approach</a> to content strategy.  They have different goals for their public-facing websites than consumer-focused companies.  Some complex products have months- or years-long sales cycles, making the "buyer's journey" difficult to measure.

When I started managing Locus' website, I realized we couldn't identify improvements by A/B testing for higher conversion rates.  Our traffic was low, and nothing would change that.  Our industry (enterprise environmental data management) was niche.  There was no "add to cart" experience—no one visited our website and decided to buy that day, or even that week, *or even that month*.

...But it certainly had problems.

In 2015, Locus' website was simply "existing".  It was built with static HTML files and a bit of Perl for its forms (no CMS, no dynamic content).  The marketing team added new content to it occasionally, such as press releases or blog posts.  

But no one would  claim that the website was doing anything in the way of lead generation, and everyone knew the issues that needed attention:

* Outdated site design
* Clunky forms
* No analytics
* Company-centric copy (rather than customer-centric)
* Content changes required the assistance of a developer
* Not mobile-friendly

As the company's sole interaction/UX designer (and the only person who currently knew how to edit the website), I was put in charge of this project.  This meant **I would need to wear many hats**, including:
* Establish goals and strategy for a website overhaul
* Find and hire a developer to move the site into a CMS
* Manage the developer, a graphic designer, and assistants to help migrate and update content
* Redesign the site
* Generate new and targeted content
* Lead the project through to completion by defined milestones and a final deadline


## *What are we trying to do here, anyway?* Goals and approaches

I held several rounds of high-level discussions with stakeholders.  Through these, I came up with a set of actionable, narrowly-defined problems and goals to define the project.

| What would characterize success?  | Actionable solution  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Content can be easily and frequently updated by marketing, graphic designers, executives, or other departments  | **Migrate site to a CMS** (WordPress) with various user permission levels.  |
| Site design is mobile-responsive and inline with modern web design patterns and standards, and brand elements are consistent and present throughout.  | **Adopt a modern design** that integrates our company branding (including custom icon library, fonts, and colors) with a modular, grid-based, responsive layout.  |
| Increase lead generation, keyword rankings for selected keywords, and user engagement on the website; decrease bounce rates.  | **Use analytics tools** including WebCEO, Google Analytics, and Piwik to identify prime keywords, optimize pages, and identify and implement other strategies to **increase search engine ranking and social sharing**.  |
| Accurately and thoroughly represent our product selection, providing answers to common questions raised during demos and sales calls.  | **Rework the information architecture** of the site to better represent our product selection and to better target our primary customer segments.  |
| Directly address our primary customer segments through targeted messaging to increase inquiries.  | **Add new, fresh content** targeted to specific industry customer segments. Rewrite existing content to be **more approachable and relevant for target audience**.  |


## *Where are we now?* Evaluating the existing information architecture
Even with these clear goals in hand, I still found myself trying to prove to a few key stakeholders that we needed a complete content overhaul. 

To drive the point home, **I created a complete sitemap of the existing content**.  This provided irrefutable proof that the site was bursting at the seams with duplicate, misplaced, and “fluffy” content.

Throughout the project, the sitemap became an important tool as we refined and organized content.   It also helped identify content that served the competing desires of internal stakeholders—but simply didn't matter to our audience.

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/IA-spreadsheet-stack_960x600.png" description="Having the content mapped out in one place made some problems (and opportunities) even more obvious." %}


## A single source of truth for task management
I would be leading this project from start to finish.  This included coordinating team responsibilities, prioritizing work, and managing content and design assets.  I knew that **I needed a lightweight yet robust way to delegate tasks and track progress**.

We suffered a few false starts attempting to manage tasks and progress in Google Docs.  But then, on a day I'll always remember, I found <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>.  It turned out to be the perfect editorial calendar/task delegator/bug tracker/communication platform for our project (and many other projects henceforth!).

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/mgmt-trello_960x570.png" description="This was the start of a beautiful and prosperous relationship between Trello and me." %}

## *Who is our audience?* Digging into user research

This website overhaul project was initiated by our executive stakeholders, whose initial goal was to simply “modernize” the design and content of the site (and build a CMS for easier future changes).

But by now, we realized we had to do more than find a flashy new theme and clean up the copy.  We had to rebuild the site with our actual users in mind.

* I started by **digging through our CRM archives**—reading through meeting minutes and customer correspondence to find out in the customers’ own words exactly what they needed from our software.

{% include user-quote.html content="The compliance portion is most important as we <b>can't afford to make mistakes</b> there, so the budget would reflect the value we'd get out of that." image="locustec/persona-sharon_100x102.png" description="Locus customer photo" %}
{% include user-quote.html content="Our ultimate goal is to free up environmental managers from <b>being bogged down from data/data management</b>. They just need to have quick access to data/graphs." image="locustec/persona-roger_100x102.jpg" description="Locus customer photo" reverse="reverse" %}
{% include user-quote.html content="The main area of value we derive from implementing the software is just having <b>one consolidated data source</b>. The transition from having no clear data, to implementing an enterprise-type system has been like switching a light on." image="locustec/persona-jeanne_100x102.jpg" description="Locus customer photo" %}

* I logged information about the industries, titles, goals, and concerns of these customers in a spreadsheet.

* I also reviewed LinkedIn profiles of both our actual customers and other environmental professionals with similar titles.

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/research-spreadsheet_960x780.png" description="I compiled actual quotes and data about our customers from CRM and LinkedIn." %}

* Case studies and testimonials from **competitors’ websites** also provided rich insight as to what our target audience considered a successful solution.

* I found **previous market research** conducted by an outside firm several years ago, but the findings were somewhat outdated.  Still, it was useful background information.

* Industry analysts and professional associations regularly publish exhaustive **industry reports** on the state of the environmental data software market. I scoured these for more direct quotes from customers in our market, as well as aggregate survey data. 

From all this information, I developed a few key personas that would guide the rest of the project.  These included prospective and current customers, end users, and employees.

{% endslider %}


## *Four hours of axe-sharpening...* Writing specifications

AAt some point, I realized I needed to document all the great ideas and tasks our team was identifying.  I started **developing an outline of the project scope, timeline, and team responsibilities and expectations**. 

This was a living document that grew as we shifted our goals and constraints. It continued to evolve throughout the user research and technical exploration process.

I compiled and maintained these specifications primarily to benefit our WordPress developer.  But it also became a defining component of the project that kept our whole team on track throughout.  The document included:

* Background of the website and its purpose
* Exploration of the need for redesign/rebuilding
* Design and technical specifications
* Sitemap and navigation
* User roles and permissions
* Analytics strategy
* Security considerations
* Maintenance and support plan
* Branding elements and resources

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/specs-document-stacks_960x370.png" description="This living document acted as our north star throughout the project." %}

## User task analysis

With our user personas and our company goals defined, I turned my focus to our users’ goals and the tasks that would help them achieve these goals.

I had enough research by now to extrapolate the steps in our prospective customer’s buying process.

Through conversations with company employees, I had also collected insight about how other visitors use the website, including:
* job applicants looking for open positions
* current customers looking at our other offerings
* current users trying to sign up for training sessions

Obviously potential customers were our primary target, but we didn't want to ignore these other audiences.  I **developed a set of user tasks, goals, known obstacles, and success criteria for each audience**.  This would help me design flows that accommodated different use cases.  I also hoped we could use these tasks as usability test cases at some point.

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/user-tasks_960x690.png" description="The tasks were essentially cross-comparisons of each persona's needs and goals." %}

## *Building signposts—* Defining a new information architecture

Based on this research, our team identified a set of important industries (*Agriculture*, *Oil & Gas*, *Nuclear*, and so on) and application “domains” (*Environmental Information Management*, *EHS Compliance*, *Sustainability*) that we wanted the website to address.

I also conducted research on our competitors' products, websites, social media presence, and other marketing materials.  This **competitor analysis** showed that pretty much everyone consistently separated “apps” and “services”.  There were also several popular top-level categories that also made sense for the content we planned. 

Of course, there were some content categories that didn’t belong in any of our ideal categories.  At first I brought these up with our team, but this quickly turned into an endless debate between personal opinions.  So I conducted **quick-and-dirty exercises like card sorting** to find a suitable home for each of them.

The task analyses I compiled also helped **keep the focus on streamlining paths to task completion**.  I tried to direct any debates about categories, hierarchy, and terminology toward these tasks.  It was far more effective to argue about "where would Sharon click to send a demo request?" than which button wording "sounded better".

After a few discussions and tweaks, the menu structure began to fall into place.

  ![Finally the menu structure began to fall into place.]({{ "/assets/locustec/new-mockup-menu_960x520.png" | absolute_url }})
{% endslider %}

## Design iterations

In early iterations, I focused on how to arrange the content, largely ignoring visual details and branding elements.  As I was the only designer on the team and had my hands full with research, content production, and project management, we made the decision to <a href="http://codex-themes.com/scalia/" target="_blank">purchase a WordPress theme</a> and customize it as needed.

This would save us the time of coming up with a design entirely from scratch and let us focus on creating content and information architecture that served our goals.

After we nailed down the content and the WordPress theme, I was happy to have constraints to work within in terms of iconography, typography, and overall layout.  The developer and I worked together to pick out plugins, tweak the layout and CSS, and develop a visual design system (icons, colors, fonts) that would appropriately and professionally represent our company brand.

Once we had a few pages in the new theme, and after guiding the developer through a number of improvements to the CSS, I brought the designs to stakeholders for feedback and iterative adjustments.

{% include project-image.html file="locustec/design-iterations_960x1230.png" description="Various design explorations, before and after deciding on a WordPress theme." %}

## Final product

Despite having a number of wishlist items remaining on our to-do list, we held fast to our decided go-live date and set the new site loose into the world as scheduled.

Sadly, we had no record of conversion rates from the old website, as the site infrastructure and technical setup of the submission forms prevented us from using Google Analytics goals/events to track this activity.

Since we didn't have any conversion rate benchmark to compare to the new site results, our goal was to establish this benchmark in the first few months of the new site go-live date, and improve the results gradually over time.

You can visit the site in its current form at [https://locustec.com](https://locustec.com).

## Ongoing work

I set up a variety of analytics and interaction tracking tools to start collecting site usage data from the moment the site went live.

However, we could be making much better use of our tracking tools with more time and resources devoted to site monitoring and analysis.

Some metrics that are important for B2B products like ours require more complex report setup, like [frequency and recency of site visits](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/frequency-recency/), which better reflect our customers' long, research-heavy journeys.

Conversion rates for our various contact forms have remained mostly stable since we launched the new site.  Ideally, we could investigate this stagnancy by conducting actual user interviews or diary studies.  We could also try using tools like Hotjar's surveys to implement real-time feedback channels from visitors.

## Reflections

### What went well?

#### Just enough time for planning
   We gave ourselves a generous timeline, allotting more time at the beginning for discussions and planning than we thought we would need.  It turned out that we needed every minute of it!  The specifications I compiled became a guiding beacon for us as the project evolved, keeping us on point and on track when the scope threatened to expand.

#### Having a dedicated, skilled front-end developer was a godsend
   On many other projects, I was largely responsible for front-end development as well as design.  On this project, we hired a talented WordPress developer whose front-end skills were up to par, so I was able to focus largely on research, information architecture, task flows, and content.

#### Dedicating ample time to user research at the beginning made the way forward clear and kept the team on target
   Compiling a clear picture of our users (customers) saved us a lot of time and headache, especially in meetings about content or menu structure that threatened to devolve into power struggles between stakeholders.  The answer to many questions was “what would our user Sharon look for?” or “do Paul, Jeanne, or Roger really care about that?”


### What didn't go well?

#### Need to budget more time & resources for testing
   We didn’t conduct much user testing beyond casually watching our colleagues look for certain content on the site and making minor improvements based on these observations.  Our audience is rather niche, so user testing with users representative of our personas would be a challenge.  One idea might be to recruit some of our current product users to simulate using our site to shop for a new solution.

#### No staff copywriter—an interesting challenge
   I’ve always been interested in copywriting, but we literally had to rewrite all of the content on the website to reorient it around our audience and their goals.  Myself and one of our executive stakeholders were the most experienced writers, so we ended up writing literally all the copy.  Working at a small company means you get to try on all sorts of hats, but the website would certainly benefit from a professional copywriter.

#### Develop a more mature analytics monitoring plan
   We also lacked resources to properly plan and create a long-term monitoring strategy for the analytics of the site.  I set up Google Analytics, Piwik, and various other tools (Hotjar, Fullstory), but without someone keeping tabs on the data and identifying opportunities for improvement, we’re not getting much benefit from it.
