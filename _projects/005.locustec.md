One sentence overview of this awesome project

## Goal
Redesign and rebuild Locus Technologies’ website to better support its goals of attracting and converting new customer leads and promoting the company as a thought leader in its industry; as well as to make it easier for multiple people within the company to add, edit, and manage content on the website.

## Overview
With the help of a great team including a WordPress developer, content writers, and stakeholders contributing mostly to marketing strategy, I drove the design and development of the new website, from ideation to implementation.

## My Role
* UX design
* UX research
* Information architecture
* Interaction design
* Content strategy
* Copywriting
* SEO strategy
* Project manager

## Background
![Screenshots of pre-redesign website]({{ "http://via.placeholder.com/500x350" | absolute_url }})

Boutique environmental data management software company founded in 1997.

In 2015, website was built with static HTML files (no CMS, no dynamic content).

* Outdated site design
* Clunky forms
* No analytics
* Company-centric copy (rather than customer-centric)
* Content changes required the assistance of a developer
* Not mobile-friendly

## Taking stock of existing information architecture
Before even thinking about possible new approaches to design or content, I created a sitemap of the existing content.

This provided painful proof to all stakeholders that the site had heaps of duplicate and misplaced content.

Throughout the project, the sitemap would prove to be an important tool to refine and organize the content we needed to share— and to identify what was only serving the desires of the company but just wasn’t important to our users.

## Trello for task & project management
I knew from the beginning that I wanted a lightweight yet robust way to delegate tasks throughout the project and track progress.

After a few false starts attempting to manage tasks and progress in Google Docs, Trello turned out to be the perfect editorial calendar/task delegator/bug tracker/communication platform for our project.

Our team included:
* 1 WordPress developer
* 1 content migrator
* 1 graphic designer
* 3 executive stakeholders
* Myself

## Research

This website overhaul project was spearheaded by our executive stakeholders, whose main goal was to “modernize” the design and content of the site (and build a CMS for easier site changes).

But I knew we had to do more than find a flashy new theme and clean up the copy.  We had to rebuild the site with our actual users in mind.

I started by **digging through our CRM archives**—reading through meeting minutes and customer correspondence to find out in the customers’ own words exactly what they needed from our software.

I logged information about the industries, titles, goals, and concerns of these customers in a spreadsheet.

I also **reviewed LinkedIn profiles** of the actual customers and others with similar titles.

Case studies and testimonials from **competitors’ websites** also provided rich insight as to what our target audience considered a successful solution.

**Previous market research** conducted by an outside firm was somewhat outdated and largely based on stakeholder assumptions, but it was useful background information.

Industry analysts and professional associations regularly publish exhaustive **industry reports** on the state of the environmental data software market— I scoured these for more direct quotes from customers in our market, as well as aggregate survey data. 

From all this information, I developed a few key personas that would guide the rest of the project.

These included prospective and current customers, end users, and employees.

## Goals and proposed solutions

| What would make the website better?  | Actionable solution  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Content can be easily and frequently updated by marketing, graphic designers, executives, or other departments  | **Migrate site to a CMS** (WordPress) with various user permission levels.  |
| Site design is mobile-responsive and inline with modern web design patterns and standards, and brand elements are consistent and present throughout.  | **Adopt a modern design** that integrates our company branding (including custom icon library, fonts, and colors) with a modular, grid-based, responsive layout.  |
| Increase lead generation, keyword rankings for selected keywords, and user engagement on the website; decrease bounce rates.  | **Use analytics tools** including WebCEO, Google Analytics, and Piwik to identify prime keywords, optimize pages, and identify and implement other strategies to increase search engine ranking and social sharing.  |
| Accurately and thoroughly represent our product selection, providing answers to common questions raised during demos and sales calls.  | **Rework the information architecture** of the site to better represent our product selection and to better target our primary customer segments.  |
| Directly address our primary customer segments through targeted messaging to increase inquiries.  | **Add new, fresh content** targeted to specific industry customer segments. Rewrite existing content to be more approachable and relevant for target audience.  |

## Developing specifications

Next, I developed an outline of the scope, timeline, participants' responsibilities, and expectations of the website redesign project. 

This was a living document that grew and adapted, as we shifted our goals and constraints following user research and technical exploration.

These specifications were compiled and maintained mainly to benefit our WordPress developer, but it became a defining part of the project that kept our whole team on track for the duration.

## Task analysis

With our user personas and our company goals defined, I turned my focus to our users’ goals and what tasks they would need to perform to achieve them.

I had enough research by now to extrapolate the steps in our prospective customer’s buying process.

Through a number of conversations with company employees, I had also gathered quite a bit of insight about how other website visitors (job applicants, current customers and users, etc.) use the website.

## Defining a new information architecture

Based on the research, our team identified a set of important industries (Agriculture, Oil & Gas, Nuclear, etc.) and application "domains" (Environmental Information Management, EHS Compliance, Sustainability) that we wanted the website to address.

Competitor analysis had revealed a consistent segregation of "apps" and "services", as well as additional top-level categories that made sense for our planned content.

The task analysis I had compiled helped keep our categorization and hierarchy oriented toward streamlining paths to goal completion.

After a few discussions and tweaks, the menu structure began to fall into place.

## Design iterations

As I was the only designer on the team and had my hands full with research, content production, and project management, we made the decision to purchase a WordPress theme and customize it as needed.

This would save us the time of coming up with a design entirely from scratch and let us focus on creating content and information architecture that served our goals.

However, I worked iteratively with our developer to pick out plugins, tweak the layout and CSS, and develop a visual design system (icons, colors, fonts) that would appropriately and professionally represent our company brand.

## Final product

Despite having a number of wishlist items remaining on our to-do list, we held fast to our decided go-live date and set the new site loose into the world as scheduled.

Sadly, we had no record of conversion rates from the old website, as the site infrastructure and technical setup of the submission forms prevented us from using Google Analytics goals/events to track this activity.

Since we didn't have any conversion rate benchmark to compare to the new site results, our goal was to establish this benchmark in the first few months of the new site go-live date, and improve the results gradually over time.

## Ongoing work

I set up a variety of analytics and interaction tracking tools to start collecting site usage data from the moment the site went live.

However, we could be making much better use of our tracking tools with more time and resources devoted to site monitoring and analysis.

Some metrics that are important for B2B products like ours require more complex report setup, like [frequency and recency of site visits](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/frequency-recency/), which better reflect our customers' long, research-heavy journeys.

Conversion rates for our various contact forms have remained mostly stable since we launched the new site.  Ideally, we could investigate this stagnancy by conducting actual user interviews or diary studies.  We could also try using tools like Hotjar's surveys to implement real-time feedback channels from visitors.

## Reflections

### What went well?

* **Just enough time for planning**<br>
   We gave ourselves a generous timeline, allotting more time at the beginning for discussions and planning than we thought we would need.  It turned out that we needed every minute of it!  The specifications I compiled became a guiding beacon for us as the project evolved, keeping us on point and on track when the scope threatened to expand.

* **Having a dedicated, skilled front-end developer was a godsend**<br>
   On many other projects, I was largely responsible for front-end development as well as design.  On this project, we hired a talented WordPress developer whose front-end skills were up to par, so I was able to focus largely on research, information architecture, task flows, and content.

* **Dedicating ample time to user research at the beginning made the way forward clear and kept the team on target**<br>
   Compiling a clear picture of our users (customers) saved us a lot of time and headache, especially in meetings about content or menu structure that threatened to devolve into power struggles between stakeholders.  The answer to many questions was “what would our user Sharon look for?” or “do Paul, Jeanne, or Roger really care about that?”


### What didn't go well?

* **Need to budget more time & resources for testing**<br>
   We didn’t conduct much user testing beyond casually watching our colleagues look for certain content on the site and making minor improvements based on these observations.  Our audience is rather niche, so user testing with users representative of our personas would be a challenge.  One idea might be to recruit some of our current product users to simulate using our site to shop for a new solution.

* **No staff copywriter—an interesting challenge**<br>
   I’ve always been interested in copywriting, but we literally had to rewrite all of the content on the website to reorient it around our audience and their goals.  Myself and one of our executive stakeholders were the most experienced writers, so we ended up writing literally all the copy.  Working at a small company means you get to try on all sorts of hats, but the website would certainly benefit from a professional copywriter.

* **Develop a more mature analytics monitoring plan**<br>
   We also lacked resources to properly plan and create a long-term monitoring strategy for the analytics of the site.  I set up Google Analytics, Piwik, and various other tools (Hotjar, Fullstory), but without someone keeping tabs on the data and identifying opportunities for improvement, we’re not getting much benefit from it.
