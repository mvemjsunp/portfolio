{% capture intro %}
<p>Design systems, style guides, and pattern libraries have become a hot topic among the UX community, even spawning entire <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/" target="_blank">physical</a> <a href="https://dsconference.com/" target="_blank">and</a> <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/design-systems-virtual-summit-2018" target="_blank">virtual conferences</a> dedicated to exploring the challenges and best practices of creating such systems.</p>
<p>UX teams at <a href="https://adele.uxpin.com/" target="_blank">companies and organizations big and small</a> are creating their own design systems and component libraries to promote consistency, scalability, and more efficient delivery of effective, well-designed products.</p>
<p>When there is no official resource to which developers can turn when making design and architecture decisions, they'll come up with their own solutions independently—or, in the case of legacy applications, copy existing solutions from elsewhere in the product that may no longer even adhere to current web standards.</p>
<p>During <a href="/projects/001.redesign/">the redesign</a> of our legacy environmental data management web application, it became painfully clear that we needed to establish a central source of information where developers could find out how to follow brand standards, how to construct UI components, and how to build an experience that would be consistent, efficient, and occasionally even delightful for our users.</p>

{% capture overview %}
I designed, implemented, and led the ongoing evolution of a pattern library for developers and designers on the product team.  The pattern library includes:
* Branding guidelines (colors, fonts, copywriting)
* Page layout guidelines & examples (with references to representative pages)
* How to implement widgets & plugins (with links to source documentation)
* Best practices for everything from user flows to data organization

## Background

Prior to shifting my responsibilities more toward UX design, I was a front-end developer (with particular focus in CSS and jQuery/JavaScript).  

After just a few months of building components and setting up page flows, I quickly realized our product team needed some central repository or reference system where we could document and retrieve:
* reusable components and templates
* plugin documentation
* frequently used page layouts
* guidelines for UI elements such as form inputs, data grids, and modal dialogs

In the conceptual and planning stages of this project, I started by compiling a static Google Docs document with header font sizes, brand colors, and the basic form input classes that I was starting to use over and over during the application redesign project.

## Defining the scope & compiling content

The Google Doc quickly became unmanageable, so I developed a very bare-bones, static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The pattern library was initially called a "style guide", but it evolved to be much more than a static set of branding and design guidelines.

Rather, it became a library of UI patterns that included both guidelines for usage of particular widgets, components, and layouts, as well as actual code snippets and tags that developers could simply plug into their pages.

  ![Approved branding colors for UI elements including error messages, icons, and links.]({{ "/assets/patternlibrary/pattern-library-1_960x830.png" | absolute_url }})
  ![Detailed guidelines, patterns, and examples for all available UI components, such as loading indicators.]({{ "/assets/patternlibrary/pattern-library-5_960x830.png" | absolute_url }})
{% endslider %}

### A different set of users

In this project, I faced a new challenge—the users were my own colleagues (developers).

I could see firsthand and on a regular basis when the platform failed them, and when it was a success.

A few months after introducing the pattern library to the development team, they were successfully using the patterns, but my team often found ourselves doing quite a bit of reworking when we conducted our “UX review” on their work.  I learned that the developers didn't understand (or really care about) the fundamentals of our grid system and how page layouts should resize responsively, and they weren't reading through the lengthy bullet lists of guidelines and options we provided for conditional usage of elements in different situations.  Well, I couldn't really blame them.

I addressed most of these issues by patiently sitting with developers on a one-on-one basis when I knew they'd be using the pattern library for a given case, and walking them through the steps of deciding, for example, which grid column widths to use for a given form, or whether radio buttons or select dropdowns made more sense in a certain circumstance.

## Optimizing for better usage

I had heard a lot about component libraries and UI patterns, so at this point I took some time to study some of the most well-known examples (<a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a>).  

Right away I realized there were a few key differences in how our pattern library should be used, compared to these large enterprise-level implementations.  

For one thing, in our small company, only a couple people (myself and a dedicated front-end developer) would ever modify the CSS, and I was still struggling to establish a "design before development" process within our team—so I wanted to keep a tight rein on the visual options we gave the rest of the developers.

This meant providing more comprehensive "page template"-based patterns, rather than presenting a buffet of all the possible components including button variations, font sizes, etc. 

{% include project-image.html file="patternlibrary/pattern-library-6_960x830.png" description="More real-life examples of combinations of components helped guide the developers to more consistent and elegant solutions." %}


### Creating reusable templates and tags

The pattern library is much more than a set of guidelines on how the product should look—it was also the sourcebook on how the product should be built.

We actively looked for opportunities to create new templates and tags (the product was built with ColdFusion which provides a system of “custom tags” that are essentially components).

We replaced our full HTML code patterns with these custom tag components and templates, reducing the opportunity for error and the need for other developers to guess the best way to implement our patterns.

This would also make it much easier to upgrade or migrate CSS or other front-end frameworks in the future, as framework-specific class names and HTML element structures would be stored in one place (the tag code) rather than hardcoded in hundreds of files.

{% include project-image.html file="patternlibrary/alert-examples_960x630.png" description="Alerts and modals are used on nearly every form page in our application, so they have the most options (and flexibility) of any patterns.  They were also the first components that we converted into tags and templates." %}

### Icon library

Part of the design system my team developed included a set of over 250 custom SVG-based icons (and growing).

We built an interactive library for developers, marketing, sales, and anyone else to use in applications, presentations, or other collateral.

Anyone can also request new icons if modules or topics that aren’t represented by existing icons are being developed.  When I realized we were getting a lot of requests for icons that already existed under different names or terminologies, I had the idea to add “definitions” to each icon, explaining the context in which they are (or could be) used.

After we finished compiling all the definitions, my team’s front-end developer rebuilt the library using React components, building in search functionality for the definitions.

{% include project-image.html file="patternlibrary/icolocus_960x500.png" description="Our graphic/visual media designer creates and manages the icons themselves, and the library site is integrated into our larger design system.  We built in options to change icon size, color, background/foreground style, and hover styles." %}

### Brand manual

There were also some non-product-specific, company-wide branding and style standards that I had unwittingly taken ownership of over the years: editorial language and style, logo usage, product screenshot requirements, and typography in marketing materials, among others.

## Reflections

### What went well?

#### Aggressively directing developers to the pattern library rather than fixing UI problems for them supported usage of the system.
   Developers would frequently message me asking how to make a widget work in a particular type of form, and during my team’s design review stage on certain features, we would encounter various patterns that had been set up incorrectly.  It is very tempting to fix these things ourselves, but I realized it was more sustainable in the long-term to point the original developer to the relevant information in the pattern library and have them fix it themselves.

#### Developers love templates and seek out examples to follow.
   The average developer is not going to build a module by copying pattern by pattern from even the most elaborate, complete guide.  She is going to find a similar example that has already been implemented and tweak it according to her needs.  Realizing this (after countless instances of encountered long-deprecated classes and HTML elements in newly-developed pages), I made an effort to provide “approved” examples of various patterns that devs could actually use as a reference and trust that they’re adhering to current guidelines.  I also worked with our front-end developer to convert as many patterns into reusable components as possible.

### What didn't go well?

#### The static HTML structure of the pattern library became unwieldy.
   Just as we quickly outgrew the Google Doc where the pattern library was born, so have we outgrown our static HTML page where we store the entire pattern library.  We plan to migrate it into a more modular, dynamic framework soon, perhaps React (as we’re considering using React for our product application, it would be a great test run).

#### Too much text is a turn-off.
   As we used components and widgets in more and more places, we continuously expanded them, built in more options, and developed ever-growing guidelines for usage. This information ended up as long bullet lists in the pattern library.  Eventually I started creating more example-based “do’s and don’ts” for easier scanning.
