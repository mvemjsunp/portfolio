{% capture intro %}
<p>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has a long and complex <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/environment/" target="_blank">history of environmental impact</a> on the surrounding region.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Laboratory introduced <a href="https://intellusnm.com/home/about_intellus.cfm" target="_blank">a public-facing portal</a> to its environmental monitoring data.  The public website would help LANL be more transparent, promoting a better relationship with its community.</p>
<p>But the original website was modeled after their internal data management software, with complex filters and terminology catering to environmental scientists. Users complained that the website was too complicated for the average Los Alamos citizen.</p>
<p>So in 2017, we decided to <b>redesign the Intellus website to make it more accessible to the average, non-scientific user</b>.</p>

## *"...an intentional obfuscation of information...  "*
In 2012, Locus Technologies—an environmental data software company—developed a public-facing website for Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

This website (<a href="https://intellusnm.com" target="_blank">Intellus New Mexico</a>) is an interface to the environmental monitoring data that LANL manages in Locus’ [enterprise SaaS product](/projects/002.redesign/) (EIM). The database search interface on Intellus was modeled after EIM, with lots of the same complex terminology and filters.

However, much of Intellus' intended audience are Los Alamos residents who *don't* have a scientific background.  Still, they are acutely aware of the history of contamination in the air, water, and soil near their homes and workplaces. This includes several vocal activist groups, some representing indigenous peoples who have lived on the land for centuries. These groups keep a close eye on LANL’s environmental activities and its regulatory compliance.

During training sessions and in conversations with users, LANL **kept receiving complaints from residents that Intellus was too hard to use**:

{% include user-quote.html content="I went to your website to see what was there. It seems like an intentional obfuscation of information, or at least that is the impact. I’m guessing that most visitors to the site would be the feel <b>overwhelmed by sheer volume</b> and possibly give up providing any opinion or response. " image="publicsearch/persona-image-dennis.png" description="Intellus user photo" %}
{% include user-quote.html content="Has anyone tried to use the [Intellus] website yet? I'm not quite ready to call it worthless, but <b>I put a few hours into trying it</b> and I can safely say the public has no more information about contamination from LANL than it did yesterday. I wonder what this cost... " image="publicsearch/persona-image-jenny.png" description="Intellus user photo" reverse="reverse" %}
{% include user-quote.html content="Saying that all the data is accessible virtually comes from the voice of someone with an elitist and highly privileged background, who does not know what it's like to live in a rural community [...] hardly anyone can figure out <b>how to find information that matters to them in a complex database full of specialized terminology</b>. " image="publicsearch/persona-image-elena.png" description="Intellus user photo" %}

LANL wanted a consolidated, more approachable search flow for commonly-made queries to **improve their relationship with local residents**. They provided a basic outline of the required data types and filter options, then asked us (at Locus) to  design the flow and interface.

By this time, I had gotten to know our highly technical EIM user base.  I was looking forward to the challenge of researching and designing for the goals, experiences, and needs of a completely new set of users.

{% endslider %}

## Documenting the existing information architecture
Before we could consider how to improve the data search experience, we needed a better picture of the current situation.  So I mapped out the existing website and its various data search forms and results tables.

I documented all the filter options on each search page. This made it **easy to identify consistencies and patterns** that we could use to design a new, consolidated flow.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/old_sitemap_960x470.png" description="A comprehensive map of all the content in the website—seeing the content of all the forms in one place made opportunities for consolidation obvious."  %}

## Task, project, team management

The project team included 3 developers, a product manager, a project manager, customer stakeholders, and myself.

Our main objective was to design and build a streamlined version of the database search.  We would also need to redesign the rest of the application to get rid of complex terminology and filters.

Once again, I turned to <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> for easy yet robust task tracking and collaboration.  We used it to keep track of requirements, deadlines, design assets, and communication.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/trello-board_960x650.png" description="Trello just makes any project better." %}

## Getting very resourceful with user research
This project was different from other projects I worked on at Locus, in that the primary users were not actually our customers.  I had to get creative to find out more about these people and their goals.

I did know that our target users were living in a specific area and had specific goals and interests related to one topic: *environmental contamination and monitoring in the Los Alamos area*.

I also realized that **some of the goals of our customer stakeholders would be at odds with those of the public users**.  For example, LANL scientists wanted to present a certain image of their cleanup and monitoring efforts.  The public users wanted to know if LANL ever failed to comply with regulations. This presented an interesting dichotomy throughout the project.

With this knowledge, **I needed to develop very mature user personas to keep the non-scientist users front and center**.   I hoped they would help prevent our customer stakeholders from acting as the &ldquo;voice of the user&rdquo;.  

I researched activist blogs, documented records of public hearings and permit meetings, and chat forums in the Los Alamos area.  There was an no shortage of dialogue about environmental concerns in Los Alamos. I used the information I found to build personas to represent the different user types.

Some common threads in the complaints:
* Too much scientific terminology
* Takes too long to fill out complicated forms, only to get to a frustrating "no results" page
* Not sure how to find "locations near my house" or "near my child's school"
* Not sure how to interpret results
* Too many different forms—which one should I use?
* Filter options limited to 10 locations, 10 chemicals, when I really want to search "all chemicals near my house", for example

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/research_board_960x660.jpg" description="I put my research progress up on a board in the middle of the office, organizing common user questions on Post-its into logical categories, and keeping the personas as my centerpoint." %}

### Building personas, building knowledge
I filled in the gaps in my knowledge and research by talking with our customer stakeholders. They had trained members of the public in using the site, so they knew specific questions that real people try to answer with Intellus.

I assigned these questions to my personas based on their scientific knowledge and motivations.  Later, **we internally tested the search interface for each of these questions to confirm that each persona could easily find the answers they needed**.

With more time and budget, the next best step would have been to visit Los Alamos and interview some users to validate my personas (and do some user testing with my prototypes).  I'm sure having even a few conversations with Los Alamos residents would have revealed even more insights about the kinds of questions and concerns our users might bring to the Intellus website.

{% endslider %}

### Consolidating user goals into a new flow
From each persona's goals and “potential questions”, I identified what information they were likely (and unlikely) to know.  Depending on the user, they may or may not know which locations, dates, chemicals, or environmental medium they are interested in. 

I considered the different combinations of data that different users might start with.  Then, I developed a series of questions to walk users through the relevant filter selections.  **Users could skip certain steps if they didn't know specific information (this was a major shortcoming of the existing site)**.  Ultimately, answering these questions would lead them to a table of results.

We also needed to combine several disparate data types into a single flow—chemicals, groundwater levels, precipitation measurements, and so on.  Behind the scenes, some complex branching logic would be necessary.  This logic stays hidden from the users, who only have to answer the questions presented to them.

But I furiously avoided any questions or options that were too technical or ambiguous for our non-scientist users.  **The primary goal of the new “quick search” was to spare these users from frustrating, complex forms**.  

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_user-flow_960x1230.png" description="The new flow for the 'quick search' would walk users through a series of simple questions, based on the common threads throughout frequently asked questions." %}

## Maturing the flow and moving toward a design
After several iterations, I finalized the process flow with our stakeholders and fleshed it out into detailed functional specifications for developers to follow.

This diagram includes:
* conditional display of options
* which sections were common across branches and should therefore be “template-ized”
* links to mockups or wireframes for each section (later added in as I produced them)
* specific input types and options for each question

This seemed like the right time to start **discussing implementation with the developers who would be working on this project**.  I met with the front-end developer to discuss ideas for a dynamic form.  Then, we met with the back-end developer, who began considering how she could query and return data throughout the form.  

I always like to have plenty of time upfront for creative design and discovery without technical constraints.  But **as soon as the project starts coming into focus, it's helpful to bring in the developers to identify any major technical hurdles**.  This way, they have plenty of time to explore possible solutions.  In the rare case that there aren't any feasible solutions, I haven't yet finalized the UI specifications, so there is still room for negotiation.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_user-flow-detailed_960x1040.png" description="This flow diagram also eventually saved me from having to mockup every single iteration and alternate path." %}

### Brainstorming and sketching
After reviewing the task flows with developers, I turned to pencil and paper to start brainstorming UI design ideas.

I **explored several variations** including multi-step wizards, real-time feedback showing the "narrowing results" of the query the user was crafting, and panel-based forms.

My later variations were clearly orienting around a panel-based structure.  Each step would need to be "saved" so users could always go back to previous steps to change their selections.  This would help prevent the dreaded "no results" dead-end that was so frustrating for users.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/sketch-collage_960x800.jpg" description="Just a subset of many early iterations of the form fields layout and panel flow." %}

### Building wireframes and a clickable prototype
Now that I had the step-by-step flow nailed down, I created wireframes based on my sketches.

I hooked these up into a clickable prototype.  Finally, I had something to present to our ever-patient customer stakeholders.  They loved the single-page, step-based flow and simple, question-based language. We all felt **optimistic that this would address many of the ongoing user complaints**.

Together, we worked through a few rounds of fine-tuning the copywriting and functionality. Everyone was eager to get the ball rolling on development.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_prototype_960x920.png" description="The clickable prototype ensured that we had covered the basic use cases and interactions and gave us the confidence to move forward with development." %}

### Compiling design specs for developers

This was one of my first projects at Locus where I wasn't at least somewhat responsible for building the front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  There was a dedicated front-end developer on my team so that I could dedicate more time to UX and design.

I provided the developer with detailed specifications on page layout, fonts, colors, spacing, and so on.  We **worked together to adjust as needed to ensure standardized Sass-based CSS that fit into our existing framework**.  I also annotated each screen to provide more information on dynamic elements and interactions.

This worked out great!  Because I was so familiar with our existing style components, I could design the new UI elements with these in mind. The developer then simply extended existing classes and components to produce the new styles.  

I also knew what our existing front-end framework already supported in terms of dynamic interaction and local storage (versus having to send requests to the server). I was able to provide highly specific guidance in the interaction specs that absolutely **helped speed up the development process**.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_dev-specs-2_960x490.png" description="Quick and easy dev specs generated from Zeplin." %}

## Implementation and negotiations

As the developers were building the module, I was constantly communicating with them.  I made myself available to answer questions about interactions and UI responses, but also to negotiate particularly complex workflows.

In a few spots, the developers had significant **trouble developing a solution that met my design specs and also performed well in the browser**.

For example, one major issue with the existing data query forms was how easy it was to spend several minutes making filter selections, only to reach a disappointing "no results" table.  Due to the variety of possible filter selections, you could easily select combinations of filters that simply didn't match any sampling activities.

I wanted the steps in the quick search to "filter down" the available options in each step based on the previous steps’ selections.  But this would have required the developers to design and construct several new, complex query structures that would cause us to exceed our project estimates.  So we agreed to put that in a future enhancement request.

In the meantime, we came up with **intermediary preventative measures** including:

* <strong>Adding an inline map</strong> so you could confirm your selected locations were actually what you wanted
* Making it <strong>easy to return to previous steps</strong> and modify your selections—only resetting subsequent selections when needed
* Making sure we added in the <strong>ability to save queries</strong> so you could easily rerun a query again and again, after creating it once (which initially wasn’t in the scope for this project, but we deemed it so valuable that we convinced the stakeholders and project managers to let us squeeze it in)

## Final product

After the developers worked their magic, and after plenty of grooming, tweaking, and fine-tuning the details—we sent the project through testing and then deployed it live, along with the other components of the redesign.

## Outcomes

Our customer stakeholders were thrilled that the new Quick Search and the rest of the redesigned website was launched on time and within budget.

My work helped LANL to feel confident they were providing a simpler, more understandable interface to their environmental monitoring data.  This would address many of the ongoing complaints from local residents who had struggled with using the website to access and interpret the Los Alamos area data.

Before the launch, I installed Google Analytics and <a href="https://www.fullstory.com" target="_blank">FullStory</a>. This would let us identify any problem areas and track metrics like overall traffic, successful form completions, and whether users seem to navigate the new quick search easily.  I hoped to have further opportunities to work on the site in the future, so that we could take advantage of the metrics we'd collected to identify and pursue measurable goals.


## Reflections

### What went well?

#### Constant communication and trust in a skilled front-end developer gave me confidence to explore new and different approaches and design solutions.
   In past projects, I was usually involved in or responsible for producing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the design.  This leads me to design solutions that I can confidently build—but it can sometimes discourage me from being exploratory and taking risks.  Having someone else take this responsibility gave me courage to search for the best solution, instead of the one that was easiest to build. 

#### By following a more agile process than usual, we had more flexibility throughout development, and it was easier to shift course when needed.
   Our product team was still very "waterfall" despite following some "agile" methods (like scrum).  A PM produced requirements, I produced designs and handed them off to a developer, who put their head down and churned out the implementation, which was then tested and deployed.  
   <br/>
   For this project, we had a lot more freedom and less-defined requirements.  Through research, I identified user goals and needs, which became our requirements.  Based on these, I designed wireframes covering the core user flows.  Then, I worked closely with developers to build a working prototype, which we iteratively adapted and improved.  Together, we discussed compromises and negotiations for any technical hurdles we encountered.  This helped us deliver a final product that fulfilled stakeholders’ expectations, met users’ needs, and maintained the integrity of my initial designs.


### What didn't go well?

#### I need to better convey the value of personas (and research in general) to the whole team.
   Our stakeholders gave me freedom to spend time on user research for this project. But when I presented the personas to the team to ensure everyone knew our target users, there was a lot of skepticism and uncertainty.  They asked questions like "Are these personas going to be published on the site?" and "when will we get to see the new UI?" This was discouraging, and I felt rushed to stop research and get to designing—long before I felt confident in the discoveries.  In the future, I would reconsider sharing the personas with such a broad team.  Or I could find better ways to present the value of UX process and research for stakeholders unfamiliar with it.

#### Not being co-located with stakeholders introduced unforeseen complications throughout the project.
   A surprising challenge in this project was not being co-located with any of the customer and internal stakeholders. Having research discussions over audio-only conference calls was difficult and awkward at times. Meeting in person (or at least with video) would have made it easier to communicate and negotiate.  In the future I intend to make every effort to do so.

#### The final product still failed to address some stakeholder and user concerns.
   One of the biggest concerns for both the public users *and* our customer stakeholders was how to understand Intellus data in context.  When a user reaches a table of results, it doesn't answer their real questions, like "why is this chemical concentration increasing?" or "is it safe for my son to play in the dirt in this area?"  Our LANL stakeholders have also seen users misinterpret data.  For example, a sampling result might suggest a high concentration of a chemical, but it might be a QC (quality control) sample or waste data that was removed from the site.  This kind of information isn't obvious to the casual user.  We discussed these issues among our team but decided it was beyond the scope of this redesign.  Possible solutions are a FAQ or more in-app help and guidance for users looking at results.
