<p>Design systems, style guides, and pattern libraries have become a hot topic among the UX community, even spawning entire <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/" target="_blank">physical</a> <a href="https://dsconference.com/" target="_blank">and</a> <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/design-systems-virtual-summit-2018" target="_blank">virtual conferences</a> dedicated to exploring the challenges and best practices of creating such systems.</p>
<p>UX teams at <a href="https://adele.uxpin.com/" target="_blank">companies and organizations big and small</a> are creating their own design systems and component libraries to promote consistency, scalability, and more efficient delivery of effective, well-designed products.</p>
<p>When there is no official resource to which developers can turn when making design and architecture decisions, they'll come up with their own solutions independently—or, in the case of legacy applications, copy existing solutions from elsewhere in the product that may no longer even adhere to current web standards.</p>
<p>During <a href="/projects/002.redesign/">the redesign</a> of our legacy environmental data management web application, it became painfully clear that we needed to establish a central source of information where developers could find out how to follow brand standards, how to construct UI components, and how to build an experience that would be consistent, efficient, and occasionally even delightful for our users.</p>

{% capture goal %}
Establish a comprehensive set of design standards and patterns for the company's flagship environmental data management software, to serve as a resource for developers and designers working on the application, as well as additional branding guidelines for marketing, copywriting, and customer communications.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture overview %}
I designed, implemented, and led the ongoing evolution of a pattern library for developers and designers on the product team, as well as a brand manual for marketing and customer communications.  These included:
* Branding guidelines (colors, fonts, copywriting)
* Page layout guidelines & examples (with references to representative pages)
* How to implement widgets & plugins (with links to source documentation)
* Best practices for everything from user flows to data organization

## Background

Prior to shifting my responsibilities more toward UX design, I was a front-end developer (with particular focus in CSS and jQuery/JavaScript).  

After just a few months of building components and setting up page flows, I was already overwhelmed with having to constantly &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; after the other developers on our team to bring their work in line with the design standards I was slowly establishing.  I realized our product team needed some central repository or reference system where we could document and retrieve:
* reusable components and templates
* plugin documentation
* frequently used page layouts
* guidelines for UI elements such as form inputs, data grids, and modal dialogs

In the conceptual and planning stages of this project, I started by compiling a static Google Docs document with header font sizes, brand colors, and the basic form input classes that I was starting to use over and over during the application redesign project.

## Defining the scope & compiling content

The Google Doc quickly became unmanageable, so I developed a very bare-bones, static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The pattern library was initially called a "style guide", but it evolved to be much more than a static set of branding and design guidelines.

Rather, it became a library of UI patterns that included both guidelines for usage of particular widgets, components, and layouts, as well as actual code snippets and tags that developers could simply plug into their pages.

  ![Detailed guidelines, patterns, and examples for all available UI components, such as loading indicators.]({{ "/assets/patternlibrary/pattern-library-5_960x830.png" | absolute_url }})
{% endslider %}

### A different set of users

In this project, I faced a new challenge—the users were my own colleagues (developers).

I could see firsthand and on a regular basis when the platform failed them, and when it was a success.

A few months after introducing the pattern library to the development team, they were successfully using the patterns, but my team often found ourselves doing quite a bit of reworking when we conducted our “UX review” on their work.  I learned that the developers didn't understand (or really care about) the fundamentals of our grid system and how page layouts should resize responsively, and they weren't reading through the lengthy bullet lists of guidelines and options we provided for conditional usage of elements in different situations.  Well, I couldn't really blame them.

I addressed most of these issues by patiently sitting with developers on a one-on-one basis when I knew they'd be using the pattern library for a given case, and walking them through the steps of deciding, for example, which grid column widths to use for a given form, or whether radio buttons or select dropdowns made more sense in a certain circumstance.  After doing this once or twice, I found that a developer seemed to adopt a more conscious way of making UI decisions and even make requests for new component use cases and examples to be added to the pattern library!

  ![A sidebar menu pattern with several examples of actual usage in the application.]({{ "/assets/patternlibrary/pattern-library-3_960x830.png" | absolute_url }})

{% endslider %}

## Optimizing for better usage

After the pattern library had been established for awhile, component libraries and design systems seemed to become a pretty hot topic in the UX world, so I took some time to study some comprehensive and well-known examples (<a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a>).  

Right away I realized there were a few key differences in how our pattern library should be used, compared to these large enterprise-level implementations.  

For one thing, in our small company, only a couple people (myself and a dedicated front-end developer) would ever modify the CSS, and I was still struggling to establish a "design before development" process within our team—so I wanted to keep a tight rein on the visual options we gave the rest of the developers.

This meant providing more comprehensive "page template"-based patterns, rather than presenting a buffet of all the possible components including button variations, font sizes, etc. 

{% include project-image.html file="patternlibrary/pattern-library-6_960x830.png" description="More real-life examples of combinations of components helped guide the developers to more consistent and elegant solutions." %}


### Creating reusable templates and tags

The pattern library is much more than a set of guidelines on how the product should look—it was also the sourcebook on how the product should be built.

We actively looked for opportunities to create new templates and tags (the product was built with ColdFusion which provides a system of “custom tags” that are essentially components).

We replaced our full HTML code patterns with these custom tag components and templates wherever possible, reducing the opportunity for error and the need for other developers to guess the best way to implement our patterns.

This would also make it much easier to upgrade or migrate CSS or other front-end frameworks in the future, as framework-specific class names and HTML element structures would be stored in one place (the tag code) rather than hardcoded in hundreds of files.

{% include project-image.html file="patternlibrary/alert-examples_960x630.png" description="Alerts and modals are used on nearly every form page in our application, so they have the most options (and flexibility) of any patterns.  They were also the first components that we converted into tags and templates." %}

### Icon library

Part of the design system my team developed included a set of over 250 custom SVG-based icons (and growing).

We built an interactive library for developers, marketing, sales, and others in the company to find and use the icons in applications, presentations, or other collateral.

Anyone could also request new icons if modules or topics were being developed that weren't represented by existing icons.  When I realized we were getting a lot of requests for icons that already existed under different names or terminologies, I had the idea to add “definitions” to each icon, explaining the context in which they are (or could be) used.

The next planned enhancement to the library is for my team’s front-end developer to rebuild the library using React components, building in search functionality for the definitions.

{% include project-image.html file="patternlibrary/icolocus_960x500.png" description="Our graphic/visual media designer creates and manages the icons themselves, and the library site is integrated into our larger design system.  We built in options to change icon size, color, background/foreground style, and hover styles." %}

### Brand manual

There were also some non-product-specific, company-wide branding and style standards that I had unwittingly taken ownership of over the years: editorial language and style, logo usage, product screenshot requirements, and typography in marketing materials, among others.

I led the creation of the Brand Manual website.  Previously, the editorial guidelines were in about 6 different dated versions of a PDF document compiled by some intrepid but long-gone Marketing team member.  There were no central guidelines for color, typography, logos, or any of the other content that I compiled with the help of our Visual Media Designer.

We built the site in WordPress so it could be maintained in the future by the Marketing department.

## Reflections

### What went well?

#### Identify a sustainable platform for your pattern library or design system.
   Just as we quickly outgrew the Google Doc where the pattern library was born, so we outgrew our static HTML page where we store the entire pattern library.  We eventually migrated it into a more modular, dynamic framework (React—as we were considering using React for our product application, it was great opportunity for a test run).  We built the Brand Manual in WordPress from the start, knowing it would be maintained long-term by Marketing, not by developers.

#### Developers love templates and seek out examples to follow.
   The average developer is not going to build a module by copying pattern by pattern from even the most elaborate, complete guide.  She is going to find a similar module that has already been implemented and tweak it according to her needs.  Realizing this (after countless instances of encountered long-deprecated classes and HTML elements in newly-developed pages), I made an effort to provide “approved” examples of various patterns that devs could actually use as a reference and trust that they’re adhering to current guidelines.  I also worked with our front-end developer to convert as many patterns into reusable components as possible.

### What didn't go well?

#### Too much text is a turn-off.
   As we used components and widgets in more and more places, we continuously expanded them, built in more options, and developed ever-growing guidelines for usage. This information ended up as long bullet lists in the pattern library.  Eventually I started to create more example-based “do’s and don’ts” for easier scanning (and I did this from the start in the Brand Manual).

#### Enforcement is an ongoing job—and someone has to take ownership of it.
  Just because you publish guidelines and announce them loudly doesn't mean everyone will follow them happily, consistently, or accurately.  For awhile after releasing the pattern library, I was confused and frustrated to see developers sometimes do exactly the opposite of what a specific component guideline instructed.  Although it was tiresome at times, I got in the habit of politely sending links to the corresponding items in the pattern library (even when I could have more easily fixed the issues myself) so they would eventually learn to check the guidelines (if only by learning that I would nag them to do so!).  I do think that the quantity of information in the pattern library is a bit cumbersome for some developers to read through during every project, so I would like to explore ways to make it more concise, visual, and simplified.
