{% capture intro %}
<p>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), a United States Department of Energy national laboratory, has a long, unique, and complex <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/environment/" target="_blank">history of environmental impact</a> on its surrounding regions.</p>
<p>The residents of the Los Alamos region are acutely aware of the history of contamination in the air, water, and soil near their homes and workplaces.  There are a number of very vocal activist groups, some representing indigenous peoples whose families have lived on the land for centuries.  These groups keep a close eye on LANL's environmental activities and its compliance with various regulatory permits.</p>
<p>In 2012, in the interest of transparency and a better relationship with the regional community, the Laboratory worked with Locus Technologies to develop <a href="http://intellusnmdata.com/home/about_intellus.cfm" target="_blank">a public-facing portal</a> to their environmental monitoring data (which is originally collected, managed, and reported within Locus' environmental data management SaaS product).</p>
<p>The original website was modeled largely after the data management software, with complex filters and terminology catering to environmental scientists.  But most of the intended audience for Intellus are members of the public, who have little or no scientific background.  Users complained in training sessions and in public meetings that the website was too complicated to provide any value to the average Los Alamos citizen.</p>
<p>After gathering plenty of user feedback, LANL and Locus decided to redesign the Intellus website to make it easier for the average, non-scientific user to find answers to their questions about environmental monitoring data from the Laboratory and its data provider partners.</p>

{% capture overview %}
Along with doing all the UX research and design, I worked closely with our client stakeholders, our in-house product managers, and the development team to bring the project from concept to completion.  I developed user personas, task flows, wireframes, mockups, and clickable prototypes for several page redesigns, and a new data "quick search" flow.

## Background
In 2012, our company had developed a public-facing website for one of our largest clients, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

This website (called <a href="https://intellusnm.com" target="_blank">Intellus New Mexico</a> is an interface to the environmental monitoring data that LANL manages in our [enterprise SaaS product](/projects/001.redesign/) (EIM). The database search interface on Intellus was largely ported over directly from EIM, with much of the same terminology and filter options.

However, a large portion of the intended audience for Intellus are members of the public, who have little or no scientific background.  During training sessions and in conversations with users, LANL representatives received lots of complaints about the scientific terminology and complexity of the search interface.

The Laboratory wanted a consolidated, more approachable search flow for the most commonly-made queries.  They provided a basic outline of which data types and filter options should be included, but left the task of figuring out the details and designing the flow and interface to us.

This was a terrifically exciting opportunity.  By this time, I had become rather familiar with (and fond of!) our highly technical user base, and the prospect of learning about and designing for the goals, experiences, and needs of a totally new set of users was a welcome challenge!

  ![Too many choices and not enough explanation or context.]({{ "/assets/publicsearch/old_analytical-2_960x850.png" | absolute_url }})
{% endslider %}

## Documenting the existing information architecture
I started by mapping out the entirety of the existing website (which consists largely of various types of data search forms and results tables).

I documented which filter options existed on which existing search pages, making it much easier to identify consistencies (and opportunities for consolidation) that we could use to design a new, consolidated flow.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/old_sitemap_960x470.png" description="A comprehensive map of all the content in the website—seeing the content of all the forms in one place made opportunities for consolidation obvious." %}

## Better task management with Trello 

The project team included about 3 primary developers, product manager, project manager, a revolving cast of stakeholders from our customer’s organization, and myself.

Along with building a “streamlined” version of the database search functionality, we would also be essentially enhancing and redesigning the rest of the application in a series of separate cases.

To keep track of requirements, deadlines, design assets, and communication with developers, I again turned to <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> for quick yet robust task tracking and collaboration.

## Getting very resourceful with user research
This project was different from most of my projects at Locus because a large portion of the users were not actual customers of ours (or users that work for a customer of ours). Rather, the improvements would be targeting non-scientist members of the public. I had to get creative to find out more about these people and their goals.

I did know that our target users were a fairly well-defined group of people, in a very specific geographical region, with rather specific goals and needs related to one topic of interest: environmental contamination and monitoring in the Los Alamos area.

I also realized that some of the goals of our customer stakeholders would be at odds with those of the public users.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/research_board_960x660.jpg" description="I put my research progress up on a board in the middle of the office, organizing common user questions on Post-its into logical categories, and keeping the personas as my centerpoint." %}



### Building personas, building knowledge
With this knowledge, it was important to the rest of my design process to develop very mature personas of our users.
The personas were largely based on Internet research, as there is an abundance of dialogue about environmental concerns in Los Alamos, from activist blogs to documented records of public hearings and permit meetings.

I filled in the gaps in my knowledge and research by talking with our LANL stakeholders, who had trained members of the public and county workers in using former iterations of Intellus and knew specific inquiries that real people had attempted to answer using the application.

It would have been great to visit Los Alamos and interview some of the users to flesh out my personas even further—perhaps even do some user testing with my prototypes—but unfortunately this was not within the budget or time constraints of the project.

{% endslider %}


### Consolidating user goals into a new flow

From the identified user goals and “potential inquiries” of our personas, I developed a consolidated series of questions that would walk users through the relevant filter selections… and ultimately lead to a table of results.

We had to combine several disparate data types (chemicals, groundwater levels, precipitation measurements, etc.) into a single flow, so some complex branching logic would be necessary.

But I wanted to strip out any questions or options that were too technical or ambiguous for our non-scientist personas, as the primary goal of the new “quick search” was to accommodate these users who have been historically frustrated with the website’s complex forms.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_user-flow_960x1230.png" description="The new flow for the 'easy search' would walk users through a series of simple questions, based on the common threads through frequently asked questions." %}

## Maturing the flow and moving toward a design

After several iterations of the process flow, I finalized it with our stakeholders and fleshed it out into very detailed specifications for our developers to follow.

At this point, I also knew the “steps” would be organized into “panels”, so I organized the diagram accordingly. 

This diagram includes:
* conditional display of options
* which sections were common across branches and should therefore be “template-ized”
* links to mockups or wireframes for each panel (added in as I produced them)
* specific input types and options for each question

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_user-flow-detailed_960x1040.png" description="This flow diagram also eventually saved me from having to mockup every single iteration and alternate path." %}

### Brainstorming and sketching

With my task flows in a fairly solid state, I turned to pencil and paper to start hashing out ideas to translate the flow into a UI—although I confess, I had been jotting down plenty of ideas throughout the process so far!

I explored several different variations including multi-step wizards, real-time feedback showing the narrowing results of the query the user was crafting, and panel-based forms.

My later variations were clearly orienting around a panel-based structure—but one in which each step was “saved” and you could return to previous steps to change your selections at any time.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/sketch-collage_960x800.jpg" description="Just a subset of many early iterations of the form fields layout and panel flow." %}

### Building wireframes and a clickable prototype

Now that I had the step-by-step flow nailed down, I created wireframes based on my sketches.

I hooked these together into clickable prototypes and presented to our customer stakeholders.  They were thrilled with the one-page, step-based flow and simple language—we all believed this would address many of the user complaints they had been fielding.

We worked through a few rounds of fine-tuning of the copywriting and functionality, but for the most part they were eager to get the ball rolling on development.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_prototype_960x920.png" description="The clickable prototype ensured that we had covered the basic use cases and interactions and gave us the confidence to move forward with development!" %}

### Compiling design specs for developers

This was one of my first projects at Locus where I was not at least partially responsible for building the front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  I was fortunate enough to have a dedicated front-end developer on my team to do this work so that I could dedicate more time to UX and design.

I provided the developer with detailed specifications on page layout, fonts, colors, etc. using PhotoShop mockups exported into Zeplin, which automatically extracts the design details that the developer needed to build the CSS.  

I included annotations throughout the screens to provide more information on dynamic elements and interactions.

{% include project-image.html file="publicsearch/new_dev-specs-2_960x490.png" description="Quick and easy dev specs generated from Zeplin." %}

## Implementation and negotiations

As the developers worked to implement the module, I was constantly communicating with them—not just to answer questions about intended interactions and UI responses, but also to negotiate particularly complex workflows.

In a few spots, the developers had significant trouble developing a solution that met my design specs and also performed well in the browser.

For example, one major issue with the existing data query forms was how often you spend several minutes making your filter selections, only to get to a “no results” table.  I wanted the steps in the quick search to “filter down” the available options in each step based on the previous steps’ selections, but this would have required the developers to design and construct several new complex query structures that would exceed our project estimates.  So I agreed to put that in a future enhancement request.

In the meantime, we came up with intermediary preventative measures including:

* <strong>Adding an inline map</strong> so you could confirm your selected locations were actually what you wanted
* Making it <strong>easy to return to previous steps</strong> and modify your selections—only resetting subsequent selections when needed
* Making sure we added in the <strong>ability to save queries</strong> so you could easily rerun a query again and again, after creating it once (which initially wasn’t in the scope for this project)

## Final product

After the front-end and other developers worked their magic, and after plenty of grooming, tweaking, and fine-tuning the details—we sent the project through testing and then deployed it live, along with the other components of the redesign.

## Reflections

### What went well?

####Constant communication and trust in a skilled front-end developer gave me confidence to explore new and different approaches and design solutions.
   In past projects, I have usually been involved in or responsible for producing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the design.  This leads me to design solutions that I feel confident building—which keeps me from being exploratory and taking risks.  Having someone else take this responsibility gave me more courage to search for the best solution, instead of the one that was easiest to build. 

#### By following a more agile process than usual, we had more flexibility and it was easier to shift course when needed.
   Our product team is still very “waterfall” despite adopting some “agile” methods (like scrum).  A PM produces requirements, I produce designs and hand off to a developer, who puts their head down and churns out the implementation, which is then tested and deployed.
   
   For this project, we were given a lot more freedom and less-defined requirements.  My design process identified the user goals and needs, which became our requirements.  Then, I worked closely with the developers to get a working prototype based on wireframes, which we iterated, adapted, and improved together.  This helped us deliver a final product that fulfilled the stakeholders’ expectations, met the users’ needs, and maintained the integrity of my initial designs.


### What didn't go well?

#### I need to better convey the value of personas (and research in general) to the whole team.
   While the stakeholders gave me the freedom to spend time on research for this project, when I presented the personas to the team, there was a lot of skepticism and uncertainty.  They asked questions like “Are these personas being published on the site?” and “when will we get to see the new UI?” This was discouraging, and I felt rushed to stop research and get to designing—long before I felt confident in the discoveries.  In the future, perhaps I could prepare a brief presentation about the value of UX process and research for stakeholders unfamiliar with it.

#### Not being co-located with stakeholders introduced unforeseen complications throughout the project.
   A surprising and major challenge in this project was not being co-located with any of the customer stakeholders, nor our internal stakeholders. Having research discussions over an audio-only conference call was difficult and awkward at times. Having these meetings in person (or at least with video) would have been extremely beneficial for communication and getting everyone on the same page, and in the future I would make every effort to do so.
