{% capture intro %}
<p>It's natural for any software product to get more complex over time.  Customers and stakeholders are constantly requesting new features, while product teams scramble to build them in service of pleasing their users—easily fracturing what was once a cohesive user experience.  Design trends wax and wane, leaving remnants of yesterday's popular patterns and aesthetics scattered in the darkest corners of the application.</p>
<p>With enterprise/B2B products, this tendency is amplified tenfold.  Highly specialized software for niche markets may have a user base with an incredibly diverse range of business processes, needs, and internal cultures.  When a business purchases this kind of software for its employees to use, <a href="https://uxmag.com/articles/the-future-of-enterprise-design-is-consumer-grade-ux" target="_blank">it has much more power to impact the features and functionalities</a> that the software vendor chooses to develop over time than would the average consumer of a consumer-focused product.</p>
<p>This was just one aspect of the huge challenge I faced with Locus' environmental data management software.  I was put in charge of leading the redesign of a cloud software product that was built and designed by environmental engineers, for environmental engineers, and that had grown steadily (in size and complexity) over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>As I would quickly learn, the goal is not "making the complex simple"—a refrain that's so easy for anyone working on complex enterprise applications to default to.  Often, trying to force simplicity on inherently complex systems is destructive.</p>
<p>With methodical planning, comprehensive research, and careful design, I led efforts to consolidate, restructure, and improve the user interface and overall experience of the environmental software platform.</p>

Reduce friction, design and implement a consistent &ldquo;look, feel, and experience&rdquo;, and generally improve the experience of users who need to manage, track, visualize, and report on their environmental data within Locus EIM—Locus Technologies&lsquo; complex legacy web application.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture overview %}
I led a total redesign of the company's 20-year-old flagship application—a massive, complex enterprise environmental data management SaaS product.  With the support of a team open to change and a talented, dedicated front-end developer, I established a design process, produced design deliverables, and managed implementation of these designs.

## Background
Locus' flagship application, EIM (Environmental Information Management), was first introduced in 1999. It was designed and developed by environmental engineers, largely to support their work as technical consultants for clients' environmental remediation and long-term monitoring projects.

Over the years, EIM grew and grew, reflecting the ever-changing regulatory landscape and the expanding roles of environmental management professionals. Locus sometimes built out fully customized modules within EIM for some customers to accommodate their local regulations or industry-specific needs.

By the time I joined Locus, EIM was a monster of a web app, boasting more than 16,000 files (in the core project repository alone) and absolutely no design strategy.

From the user's perspective, it was just about as painful as it was powerful.

{% endslider %}

## Planning and project management
I was tasked with planning and implementing the redesign project when I first started at the company as a front-end-developer/interaction designer. For awhile, I was solely responsible for keeping this project moving forward. This included:

- Choosing and implementing a modern CSS framework (highly customized Bootstrap + Sass)
- Redesigning and rebuilding the main navigation and application layout
- Establishing standard layout components and a [pattern library/style guide](/projects/002.patternlibrary) that developers can use as a reference
- Redesigning, reorganizing, and redeveloping the entirety of the application in accordance with these standards
- Ensuring all new pages follow the standards—this usually involved some "cleaning up" after the developer, a process we (perhaps regrettably) deemed "style review"

### Expanding my team, coordinating work with product roadmap

After doing this work for about a year, I was given the blessing to hire another front-end developer (whom I would supervise) to take over the development tasks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ColdFusion, SQL), so I could focus more on design, establishing standards, ensuring quality, and prioritizing work.

I now had a lot more room to research, design, and solicit feedback for each new section of the application, prior to the developer starting on implementation.

Choosing which sections/modules to redesign and when depended on several factors.  The overall product roadmap, largely determined by product managers and customer needs, often made the decision for us. If there was a need to build a lot of new functionality or drastically rework a particular module, we would try to time the redesign in tandem with the functionality changes. This reduced time for testing and minimized the friction involved in introducing significant changes to users.

### Evaluating the existing information architecture
I set up spreadsheets which would eventually become a comprehensive site map of the entire application. Of course, it wasn't feasible to map the entire thing at once (the code repository started out at over 16k files), so the front-end developer and I updated the spreadsheet bit by bit, anytime we worked on a new section or module, whether it was undergoing a complete redesign or just a small change or feature addition.

On these spreadsheets, we noted page flows, file names, h1/h2/h3 page titles, breadcrumbs, summary of UI elements, and a color indication of the current status of the redesign (not done, in process, in testing, complete) for an at-a-glance overview.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/plan_site-map-combined_960x420.png" extraClasses="hidden-sm" description="I created a separate spreadsheet file for each main menu section, and within each file created a tab for each second-level menu item." %}
{% include project-image.html file="redesign/plan_site-map-files_960x620.png" extraClasses="hidden-md" %}

## Research

For each new section that we chose to tackle, I started with trying to fully understand its purpose—including how it was intertwined with other modules, its evolution over time, how heavily it was used and by whom, and which problems it solved for our users.

This process involved:

{% capture iconsummary %}
These could sometime be many pages long, or they might not exist at all.  If I was lucky, the help file included descriptions of each field in a form, as well as guidance to the user on the purpose of the module and how to navigate the flow.
{% endcapture %}

{% include icon-list.html icon="helpfile" title="Reading on-page help files" summary=iconsummary %}

{% capture iconsummary %}
While time-consuming to review, this platform proved to be an invaluable resource during the redesign. It was a comprehensive log of development changes (and the reasons behind them!), recurring problems, and usability issues. I especially sought out customer correspondence to better understand a given form or workflow from an actual user's point-of-view.
{% endcapture %}
   
{% include icon-list.html icon="customers" title="Combing through our bug tracking/customer correspondence system" summary=iconsummary %}

{% capture iconsummary %}
Usually these only exist for larger, more complex modules, but they provide a more significant depth of information that was actually written with new users in mind.
{% endcapture %}

{% include icon-list.html icon="documentation" title="Reading downloadable user guides" summary=iconsummary %}

{% capture iconsummary %}
   Our support team conducted monthly, hour-long webinar training sessions on selected modules, open to all customers to attend. At the end of each of these was a Q&A period where users could bring up any issues or ask how to accomplish a particular task—I often skipped ahead to these precious few minutes for a goldmine of insight.
{% endcapture %}

{% include icon-list.html icon="video" title="Watching recordings of past training videos" summary=iconsummary extraClasses="last" %}

From each of these sources, I compiled notes in a spreadsheet related to:

* Suggestions or complaints directly from users (in ticket system cases or training Q&As)
* Spots in the UI where hosts got tripped up during demos or product trainings
* Sections of help files or user guides that had to go into great detail to explain the complex machinations behind a process, or the idiosyncrasies of a particular form or flow

All of these signaled prime opportunities for improvement.

### Real user quotes

{% include user-quote.html content="In general, making [EIM] more intuitive would increase the ability of many in our company to be more comfortable and confident using the tools in the database. Currently in our company, even those familiar but not using it regularly find the database confusing and difficult to learn." %}
{% include user-quote.html content="I have to delete and start over frequently. Wish it was just a little easier to do, but it's not bad." %}
{% include user-quote.html content="I should be able to search for data in a more simple way. For example, if I need the data from the first half of 2014 from site A. I should be able to pick 'Site A' and '2014' and it gives me everything from that site and time frame. Why do I have to fill out so many boxes when I already know that I need to see everything from the last sampling event?" %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/research_spreadsheet-historical-cases_960x685.png" description="The spreadsheets, while dense with information, worked well as a guiding force to identify recurring issues and the most important areas of concern." %}

## Design

### Brainstorming and sketching
Once I understood both "the big picture" (how a given section fit into the product and the user workflow as a whole) and the details (the purpose and context of each form field or grid column, as well as conditional paths within a flow), I was ready to start ideating potential improvements.

Before jumping into Balsamiq, Photoshop, browser dev tools, or InVision, I make a point to spend some time with pen and paper, exploring at least a few variations of possible approaches.

Sometimes the changes that need to be made on a given form or workflow seem obvious based on similar pages that I’ve worked on.  Plus, being very aware of the possibilities and constraints of the widgets, patterns, and CSS components in our library tends to direct my brainstorming in certain directions.  Nevertheless, I always try to challenge myself to <a href="https://medium.com/ux-immersion-interactions/jedi-designer-tricks-for-exploring-multiple-variations-ca720aef3fe2" target="_blank">explore multiple variations</a>, and there certainly have been times when I uncover unexpected and ultimately successful solutions after spending a bit of time pushing myself to take more risks and think outside the box.

This is—without a doubt—much more effective with the freedom of pen and paper than designing in the browser or playing with combinations of existing symbols in Balsamiq.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/design-sketches_960x850.jpg" description="Putting pen to paper helps get beyond the seductive first and obvious idea." %}

### Mapping a new information architecture
Since I needed to consider the impact of changes to a given module or form across the entire application (many pages were linked from various dashboards or other forms, sometimes jumping into the middle of a form process), it was important to map out the existing files and flow.

Then, I could map out the new flow so that I (as well as the developers and testers, further down the line) could make sure all functionality was retained.

I also used the mappings as a framework for my periodic <a href="#communicating-changes-follow-up" class="smooth-scroll">“UI/UX changes” guide</a> for users and internal reference.  These included information like “_before_, you went to page A which linked to pages B, C, and D to edit these attributes—_now_, all this functionality is on one screen that’s split up into collapsible panels, which show up conditionally depending on your previous selections”.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/design-ia-new_960x670.png" description="I kept track of the old and new page flows, including which files the developers would need to deal with." %}

### Wireframes and mockups, design and development specs
On most mid-size projects, I try to put together a set of wireframes with supplementary notes as the de facto “design specifications” deliverable that the developer used as a guide for how the page or module should be set up.

I included notes about which widgets to use, special component options I knew would need to be set, UI elements that should only display conditionally, and the results of different user interactions.

I quickly learned (for more complex modules, at least) it was helpful to provide both an interactive prototype (i.e. InVision) as well as a PDF of all the wireframes/mockups with inline notes.  The PDF provides a thorough, detailed spec list, while the prototype functions as a higher-level overview of the interaction flow.

{% slider 400 bullets captions %}
  ![It's easy to keep track of the full range of UI and interaction details by creating static wireframes with inline notes and closeups of conditionally changing components or other details.]({{ "/assets/redesign/design-mocks-1_960x760.png" | absolute_url }})
  ![I like to visually represent different versions of components whenever possible, to reduce the margin for error when my designs get to development.]({{ "/assets/redesign/design-mocks-2_960x670.png" | absolute_url }})
  ![Don't make the developers guess your intent—make the object of your specification obvious with arrows and other markup.]({{ "/assets/redesign/design-mocks-3_960x710.png" | absolute_url }})
{% endslider %}
 
Depending on the familiarity I had with the developer who would be working on a given section or page (and their level of experience), I sometimes opted to provide very detailed design specifications, including code snippets with specific HTML/CSS/JavaScript that they needed to use to successfully implement my designs.

This obviously took more time that just providing wireframes and mockups, but it was necessary for more junior developers, or if we were working with newer widgets or more complex interaction flows.

Whether I provided these detailed specs or only mid-fidelity wireframes, I always strived to maintain constant communication with the developer(s) throughout the process, and I personally reviewed the changes (committed into our code repository) to be sure everything came out as intended.

## Before and after

### Best result resolution
The 'Best result resolution' form is used to identify which result to use in reporting and visualization, in the case that more than one field sample result was entered into the system (sometimes field samplers take duplicate samples for QC purposes, or lab analyses could be uploaded more than once).

{% capture bestresultbefore1 %}
Before, you reached an individual record by clicking a link in a grid of records. You were taken to a new page and could no longer see the other records.  When you saved or returned from here, you were sent back to the grid of records.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultbefore2 %}
Non-editable fields were simply disabled inputs, but they had no styling to distinguish them from editable fields. Notes were added near the form to indicate which fields were editable.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_best-result_before_960x610.png" title="Best result resolution: BEFORE" label1=bestresultbefore1 label2=bestresultbefore2 %}

{% capture bestresultafter1 %}
Now, the individual records, when clicked, appear in a dialog window above the grid of all records, keeping the context of the record always in the backdrop for quick reference.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultafter2 %}
Display information common to both compared records "across" the top of both of them—to indicate their commonality.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultafter3 %}
Icons, color-coding, white space, and standaradized headings provide clearer information hierarchies and better signaling of system status.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture bestresultafter4 %}
Since the record editing form now appears in a dialog above the grid of all records, it feels faster and less risky to save or cancel the form.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_best-result_after_960x600.png" title="Best result resolution: AFTER" label1=bestresultafter1 label2=bestresultafter2 label3=bestresultafter3 label4=bestresultafter4 %}

### Site activities calendar
The 'Site activities calendar' shows an overview of daily data input and validation activities in the system, including the number of datasets loaded and successfully validated, field samples and measurements entered, and field forms completed and submitted for processing.

{% capture calendarbefore1 %}
Before, there were options to filter the calendar for different types of data, but doing so reloaded the entire page.  You could also only view one type of data at a time (EDDs loaded, samples entered, field readings entered, etc.).  
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarbefore2 %}
Calendar dates were clickable (to view a data grid with details about the day's activities), but lacked clear affordances. 
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_calendar_before_960x450.png" title="Site activities calendar: BEFORE" label1=calendarbefore1 label2=calendarbefore2 %}

{% capture calendarafter1 %}
Now, each type of data is clickable, so you can view data grids for a specific data type and date simply by clicking the item in the calendar.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarafter2 %}
Users can click the blue icon next to each data to view a summary of the date's activities.  Tooltips on all links indicate where clicking them will lead.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarafter3 %}
Dynamic form elements update the visible calendar data as soon as they are changed—no more reloading the entire page to get new data. You can also now view all types of data at once.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture calendarafter4 %}
New option to show activities with no record count for a given day (in light gray, non-linked text) makes it easier to get a full picture of the month's activities—what did and did not occur.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_calendar_after_960x750.png" title="Site activities calendar: AFTER" label1=calendarafter1 label2=calendarafter2 label3=calendarafter3 label4=calendarafter4 %}

---

### Locations input form
This form is used to add and edit "locations", which are the basis of all field data collection and analysis activities in the system.  Most forms throughout the system followed this pattern of "view and page through records one at a time" rather than picking a record from a table of all records.

{% capture locationsbefore1 %}
“Less important” form fields were on a “Supplemental” tab, both in this view-only mode as well as edit mode.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsbefore2 %}
Before, the landing page for the Locations module was a view-only version of the first alphabetical location.  You had to page through using arrows to find a location, then click Edit to get to the editable form.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsbefore3 %}
Additional information related to locations (location aliases, reference elevations, metadata, etc.) were on separate form pages, accessed by clicking the buttons on this view-only version of a location record (the buttons aren’t on the edit form).
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_locations_before_960x630.png" title="Locations input form: BEFORE" label1=locationsbefore1 label2=locationsbefore2 label3=locationsbefore3 %}

{% capture locationsafter1 %}
I thoroughly researched every single form field on these pages to identify deprecated, duplicate, or misplaced fields (there were several!).  We also grouped similar fields under sub-panels (e.g. “Spatial information” and “Originating information”.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsafter2 %}
All information related to a location record is now visible and editable on a single page.  The information previously split up into separate form pages is grouped into collapsible panels.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture locationsafter3 %}
We built data grids of associated information right into the page, including full add and edit functionality.  Previously, these grids and forms were in an entirely different section.
{% endcapture %}

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/before-after_locations_after_960x730.png" title="Locations input form: AFTER" label1=locationsafter1 label2=locationsafter2 label3=locationsafter3 %}


## Communicating changes, follow-up
There were some hurdles in the beginning of this massive redesign effort.  After a few heavily-used areas were redesigned, some users and help desk representatives complained that the changes were unexpected and led to some confusion, as users struggled to re-learn how to complete tasks that they were used to doing a specific (albeit convoluted) way.

So for each release (about every 4-5 weeks), I began compiling a "UX release notes" document that is made available to all users in the software's Support center.  This includes all significant interface and UX changes, with detailed before-and-after notes and images for redesigned sections.  

The documents have been especially well received by the help desk staff, who use them as a reference and often send them directly to users in response to inquiries about these changes.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/ux-changes-docs_960x410.png" description="Examples of content from Monthly UI+UX Changes document sent to all project managers and users." %}

## Results and reflections
Over the course of the redesign (which took several years and eventually claimed a permanent place on the product roadmap as an “ongoing initiative”), we took every opportunity to create templates for reusable components and workflows, consolidate multi-step “wizards” into simpler dynamic forms, and identify and obliterate unused or duplicate functionality.

Through this effort (and alongside side efforts to identify deprecated files), our code repository was reduced from around 16,000 files to fewer than 6,000 files—making future maintenance, platform-wide UI or tech stack updates, help documentation efforts, and overall design and development work much more manageable and less burdensome.

{% include project-image.html file="redesign/stats-filecount.png" description="Everyone appreciates a cleaner, leaner codebase." %}

### What went well?

#### Communicate with users to alleviate the pain of change.
   After hearing that many power users found the redesign changes to be unexpected, and they struggled with the inconvenience of having to “relearn” how to use a form or module without warning. The “UX release notes” I began compiling and issuing were well-received by account managers and power users.  However, I do wish I had more time to create short demo videos or more visual or interactive explanations of the changes.  The notes were often very text-heavy which I know some users won't want to read.  I did make a concerted effort to complete and send the notes prior to the changes actually being rolled out live.

#### Establishing a design system early on (and continuously building upon it) saved time and ensured consistency.
   Shortly after embarking on the first modules of the redesign, I started compiling a [pattern library](/projects/002.patternlibrary) to keep track of the widgets we chose, common form layouts, copywriting best practices, and other standards that I was gradually developing.  This became an invaluable reference and an unbelievable boon to not only our small UX/design team during this redesign effort, but also to the development team as a whole during their work on new features.

### What didn't go well?

#### Lack of user testing led to a lot of guesswork.
   We lacked the time and resources to run any kind of user testing on initial designs or prototypes, leading to a lot of assumptions made on the basis of best practices, following existing patterns, and adhering to heuristic guidelines.  Even post-release user testing would have likely identified areas of friction or unforeseen task and process flows leading to further opportunities for improvement.

#### A bit more technical planning for the infrastructure would have made the work much easier.
   If I had a slightly larger team from the beginning, I would have liked to formulate an even more scalable tech stack for our redesigned front end.  A few years in, we started exploring React and other modern frameworks for dynamic front ends and single page applications.  Although our redesign strategy did consolidate plenty of files and screens, having something like React from the beginning would have made it _much_ easier to create truly reusable components that could be more flexibly combined.  We started slowly moving in that direction eventually, turning common components into tags and templates, but it would have been more manageable with a solid, well-supported framework.
